label: Besides work…
title: I love cycling, coconut coffee and greenery.
message: Outside of work you can often meet me on my road bike in the greater Hamburg area or even crossing the Alps. I draw inspiration and strength primarily from nature, my love for mountaineering and the photography of impressive architecture.
