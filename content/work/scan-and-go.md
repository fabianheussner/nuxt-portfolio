My Role
#headline 
From migration to integration
#text 
Digital transformation is not just about leveraging new technologies. It is a cultural shift and a journey that many traditional FMCG brands must undertake to compete in a market that now sees more and more direct-to-consumer startups. Taking over the project I faced various challenges: Getting to know the client, conceptualizing and designing the feature, and doing it during a migration from Sketch to Figma - without an existing component library, which is absolutely mandatory.
