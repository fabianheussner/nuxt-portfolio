The situation
#headline 
From migration to integration
#text 
Digital transformation is not just about leveraging new technologies. It is a cultural shift and a journey that many traditional FMCG brands must undertake to compete in a market that now sees more and more direct-to-consumer startups. Taking over the project I faced various challenges: Getting to know the client, conceptualizing and designing the feature, and doing it during a migration from Sketch to Figma - without an existing component library, which is absolutely mandatory.

The solution
#headline 
Working within the scope
#text 
One of the biggest challenges was to create a proper entry point for the feature. A restructuring of the Tab Bar was the result. The scan of a QR-Code allows users to easily enter Scan and Go and at the same time ensures the selection of the correct store without having to select it manually. By using a split screen, users always have their shopping cart in view while scanning products. To complete the purchase, users generate their own QR-Code during checkout to easily transfer the scanned products of their cart to a self-scanning terminal.

My Role
#headline 
Accompanying the whole process
#text 
During the project, I was in charge of the entire process. This included first rough concepts, the entire UI/UX Design, Visual Design, Prototyping up to the handoff to the development. Furthermore, it was possible to transfer new and also a majority of the existing components into Figma and to lay a foundation for a Multi-Platform Design System with the newly created libraries. It was an exciting project that, with its newly created infrastructure, now has the possibility to scale better and meet the ever-changing demands of consumers.
