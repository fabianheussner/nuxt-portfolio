My Role

From factual to pretty

It is truly amazing to see what is possible to achieve – and that despite this short amount of time. As UI Lead, I significantly shaped the project and made conceptual decisions. The close collaboration as UI and UX team and the constant exchange with development made it happen. A great team, a great accomplishment and a good feeling to have contributed something to the prevailing situation!
